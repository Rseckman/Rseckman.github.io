For this assignment, I was tasked with the challenge to make a responsive webpage using bootstrap css.  The goal was to make a page that has a consistant navigation bar that could lead you to three pages: About, Portfolio and Contact.  All the links on the navigation bar must lead you correctly to the corresponding page.  

-The page must pass htlm validation without errors.
-Have a responsive layout
-Have responsive images
-use semantic html

I had free reign to choose my theme and design layout.

I used bootstraps grid and layout system to organize my items with rows and columns to make sure they were responsive to screen size changes.

I used forms to create a contact page.

I also added the bonus feature to have a sticky footer on the bottom of the page.
